Gives a variable number of sites for differentation between:
 1. each pair of healthy/sick tissues, try to find sites that are not noisy in blood data
 2. each pair of healthy tissues

Questions:
1. Do we want sites that indicate there is cancer when methylated, or also vice versa?
2. Do we want sites that are close to each other or far?
3. How do we check if the sites found are noisy in the blood data?

TODOS:
2. Test random forest on multi-label (all types? all similar types?)
3. Create predictor for multi label random forest (confusion matrix or TPR TNR of each label)
4. Maybe in healthy/healthy we want to dump which direction the site decided in (i.e methylation -> type1 or type2)
5. Create visualizations for code
6. Run SVM or logistic regression on just the sites

General:
Block file:
/cs/cbio/netanel/blocks/outputs/nps20_genome.tsv.gz
col1: chr
col2: locus start
col3: locus end
col4: cpg start
col5 cpg end

Merge and add new column with format from blocks:
chr#:locus_start-locus_end

1. Implemented random forest between sick-healthy and healthy-healthy and used it to output the "most important feature" i.e the root of one of the decision trees/
    a. Achieved high accuracy
2. Ran SVM on just those features to try and distinguish between sick-healthy and healthy-healthy:



Possible datesets
cancerDetector - liver
chen - kidney



TODOS 13.06:
1. Create data folder with betas per cancer type for all datasets combined
2. Rerun algorithm

Try this with methylation data?

- Maybe use healthy data from /cs/cbio/josh/meth_array_data/GEO/ as - - - samples?
