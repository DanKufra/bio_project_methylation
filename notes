Gives a variable number of sites for differentation between:
 1. each pair of healthy/sick tissues, try to find sites that are not noisy in blood data
 2. each pair of healthy tissues

Questions:
1. Do we want sites that indicate there is cancer when methylated, or also vice versa?
2. Do we want sites that are close to each other or far?
3. How do we check if the sites found are noisy in the blood data?

TODOS:
1. Test healthy healthy creation
2. Test random forest on multi-label (all types? all similar types?)
3. Create predictor for multi label random forest (confusion matrix or TPR TNR of each label)
4. Maybe in healthy/healthy we want to dump which direction the site decided in (i.e methylation -> type1 or type2
5. Create visualizations for code
